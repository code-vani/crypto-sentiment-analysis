# Crypto Sentiment Analysis

This project investigates how **Bitcoin market sentiment** (Fear & Greed Index) influences real trading behavior using **Hyperliquid historical trader data**.

The goal is to uncover if trader decisions (PnL, leverage, volume, risk) align with market emotions and to identify signals that can enhance strategy performance.
